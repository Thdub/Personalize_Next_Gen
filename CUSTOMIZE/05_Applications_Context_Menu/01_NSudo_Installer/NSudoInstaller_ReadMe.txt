I replaced old NSudo context menu .reg file with a small installer, which allows to set the context menu depending on where YOU want to install Nsudo or where it is installed already.
It will prompt if you want to install other items as well, custom json, special tile for start menu...so you won't erase your own.

That way Nsudo context menu will work for EVERYONE, with added goodies...

Just run .bat as administrator
